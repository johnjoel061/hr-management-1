Figure 2. Request Password Reset Page
In cases where users forget their password, they can recover it via email code verification. 0nce the user submitted his/her email, the system will verify it and will send a verification code to the user email. The system will give a notification message if email code successfully sent.

Figure 3. Reset Password Page
This page is where users will enter the verification code that was sent to their registered email address in order to proceed with changing their password. By entering the correct code, users can verify their identity, ensuring that only the account owner can initiate a password reset. If the code is valid, it will be directed to the next step of creating a new password. If the code is incorrect or expired, an error message will be displayed, prompting them to either re-enter the code or request a new one. This additional layer of security helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures that the password reset process is secure and reliable.
